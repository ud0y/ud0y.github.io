## T20 Score Predictor: Cricket Score Predictor
---

* Technologies/Tools: SKLearn, Pandas, Numpy
* Github URL: [Project](https://github.com/ud0y/T20_Score_Prediction)
* Goals and Objectives of the project: <br>
    Created a machine learning model-integrated interactive web platform to forecast the cricket score after 20 overs. Essential features, including the batting and bowling teams, match location, run rate, wickets in hand, balls remaining, and previous scoring trends, were analyzed using XGBoost. The use of cutting-edge machine learning techniques for real-time sports analytics is demonstrated in this research.

## Fruit And Vegetable Recognition: Image Classiﬁcation
---

* Technologies/Tools: OpenCV, Keras, Tensorﬂow
* Github URL: [Project](https://github.com/ud0y/Fruit-and-vegetable-recognition)
* Goals and Objectives of the project: <br>
    We have experimented with the identiﬁcation of fruits and vegetables through the use of image classiﬁcation methods. Acquired photos of ﬁve novel fruit and vegetable varieties and added them to the "Fruit-360" dataset. Created, trained, and evaluated a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using the enlarged dataset. reﬁned pre-trained VGG-16 and VGG-19 models; the reﬁned VGG-19 demonstrated proﬁciency in computer vision, transfer learning, and model optimization, with 94% accuracy over 136 classes.
