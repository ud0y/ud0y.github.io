## LLAMA 3: Sentiment Analysis
---
* Technologies/Tools: Pandas, HuggingFace, Transformers, peft, SKLearn, Pybangla
* Github URL: [Project](https://github.com/ud0y/Sentiment-Analysis-using-LLM)
* Goals and Objectives of the project: In this project, I started by analyzing the raw text data and applying various preprocessing techniques, including removing unwanted text, special characters, and emojis. After cleaning the data, I used Meta-Llama-3.1-8B with 4-bit precision and ﬁne-tuned it using LoRA. This approach resulted in an accuracy of 75%.


## T20 Score Predictor: Cricket Score Predictor
---

* Technologies/Tools: SKLearn, Pandas, Numpy
* Github URL: [Project](https://github.com/ud0y/T20_Score_Prediction)
* Goals and Objectives of the project: <br>
    Created a machine learning model-integrated interactive web platform to forecast the cricket score after 20 overs. Essential features, including the batting and bowling teams, match location, run rate, wickets in hand, balls remaining, and previous scoring trends, were analyzed using XGBoost. The use of cutting-edge machine learning techniques for real-time sports analytics is demonstrated in this research.

## Fruit And Vegetable Recognition: Image Classiﬁcation
---

* Technologies/Tools: OpenCV, Keras, Tensorﬂow
* Github URL: [Project](https://github.com/ud0y/Fruit-and-vegetable-recognition)
* Goals and Objectives of the project: <br>
    We have experimented with the identiﬁcation of fruits and vegetables through the use of image classiﬁcation methods. Acquired photos of ﬁve novel fruit and vegetable varieties and added them to the "Fruit-360" dataset. Created, trained, and evaluated a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using the enlarged dataset. reﬁned pre-trained VGG-16 and VGG-19 models; the reﬁned VGG-19 demonstrated proﬁciency in computer vision, transfer learning, and model optimization, with 94% accuracy over 136 classes.

## PYBANGLA: Text Normalizer Module
---

* Technologies/Tools: Python, Regex
* Github URL: [Project](https://github.com/saiful9379/pybangla)
* Goals and Objectives of the project: <br>
    PYBANGLA, a Python3 module for Bangla Language is compatible with Django, Flask, FastAPI, and runs on Linux/Unix, Mac OS, and Windows platforms. The key features include:
    - Text Normalization: Converts dates, phone numbers, currency, symbols, abbreviations, and numbers into Bangla textual format, along with punctuation correction.
    - Number Conversion: Transforms Bangla text into numeric values.
    - Date Formatting: Parses and formats Bangla dates.
    - Emoji Removal: Cleans text by removing emojis.
    - Easily installable via pip, offering integration with various Python frameworks.

## NOKSHA: An E-commerce Website
---

* Technologies/Tools: MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS
